			<p id="A">Chicken</p>
			<p>The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>

			<p>Ducks are mostly aquatic birds and may be found in both freshwater and marine environments. There are both wild and domestic groups. Like other Anatidae, ducks have a broad body, partially webbed feet, a somewhat flattened bill with horny lamellae, and a hard process at the tip of the bill, as well as a large preen gland crowned by a tuft of feathers.</p>
